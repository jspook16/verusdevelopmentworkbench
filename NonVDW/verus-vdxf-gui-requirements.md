# Requirements for Verus VDXF Management GUI

## Overview

The Verus VDXF Management GUI is an Ubuntu-based application designed to simplify the creation, storage, management, and utilization of VDXF keys for updating contentmap and contentmultimap parameters in VerusIDs. This GUI will provide an intuitive interface for developers and users to interact with the Verus testnet blockchain's identity management system without needing to manually construct complex command-line operations. All operations will be performed exclusively on the Verus testnet (`VRSCTEST`) from a user-specified installation directory.

5.7. Enable visualization of existing contentmultimap hierarchies for the selected identity
5.8. Provide a preview of the complete `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity` command with contentmultimap parameter
5.9. Include safeguards to prevent accidental updates to production identities

### 6. Transaction Management

6.1. Display fee estimates for update operations before execution
6.2. Allow custom fee specification for priority transactions
6.3. Support the creation of update transactions for multi-signature approval (returntx parameter)
6.4. Provide transaction history for all identity updates with status and confirmation information
6.5. Enable saving draft transactions for later completion or submission

### 7. Data Visualization

7.1. Visualize contentmap relationships between VDXF keys and external content
