# Verus RPC Command: settxfee

## Purpose
The `settxfee` command sets the transaction fee per kilobyte for all subsequent transactions created by the wallet. This command is essential for controlling transaction costs, optimizing confirmation times, and managing wallet economics. It provides users with direct control over the fee-to-size ratio of their transactions, allowing them to balance cost considerations against confirmation priority based on current network conditions and personal preferences.

## Description
When executed with the appropriate parameter, this command updates the wallet's default transaction fee rate, which is used to calculate the total fee when creating new transactions. The fee rate is specified as a fixed amount of VRSCTEST per kilobyte of transaction data and is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001 (one satoshi). This setting affects all transaction types that use the wallet's automatic fee calculation, including standard transfers, multi-signature transactions, and certain shielded operations. By adjusting this value, users can influence how quickly their transactions are confirmedâ€”higher fees typically result in faster confirmation times during periods of network congestion, while lower fees may be sufficient during periods of low transaction volume. The command returns a boolean value indicating whether the new fee rate was successfully set, providing immediate feedback on the operation's success.

**Command Type**: Configuration/Wallet  
**Protocol Level**: Wallet  
**Access Requirement**: Requires wallet

## Arguments
The command accepts one required argument:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| amount | numeric | Yes | N/A | The transaction fee in VRSCTEST/kB rounded to the nearest 0.00000001 |

## Results
The command returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

**Return Type**: Boolean

## Examples

### Example 1: Set the transaction fee to 0.00001 VRSCTEST per kilobyte

**Command:**
```
verus settxfee 0.00001
```

**Sample Output:**
```
true
```

### Example 2: Using JSON-RPC via curl

**Command:**
```
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "settxfee", "params": [0.00001] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/
```

## Potential Error Cases

1. **Potential Error - Invalid Amount Format:**
   ```
   error code: -3
   error message:
   Invalid amount
   ```

2. **Potential Error - Amount Out of Range:**
   ```
   error code: -3
   error message:
   Amount out of range
   ```

3. **Potential Error - Wallet Not Available:**
   ```
   error code: -18
   error message:
   Wallet not available
   ```

4. **Potential Error - Authentication Failure:**
   ```
   error code: -1
   error message:
   Incorrect username or password
   ```

## Notes
Setting a fee that is too low may result in transactions remaining unconfirmed for extended periods, especially during times of network congestion. Conversely, setting an unnecessarily high fee may result in overpaying for transaction processing. The optimal fee rate can vary based on current network conditions, transaction priority, and size. The setting persists until changed with another call to `settxfee` or until the wallet is restarted, depending on wallet configuration.
