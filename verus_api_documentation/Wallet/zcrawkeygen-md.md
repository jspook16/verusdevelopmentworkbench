# Verus RPC Command: zcrawkeygen

## Purpose
The `zcrawkeygen` command generates a new shielded address (zcaddr) along with its corresponding secret and viewing keys. This deprecated command was designed for low-level key management, manual creation of shielded addresses, testing and development of privacy features, and direct access to cryptographic key components. It provides the cryptographic foundation for receiving and sending confidential values in the Verus ecosystem.

## Description
When executed, this command creates a new set of cryptographic keys for a shielded address, returning the address itself along with both the secret key (which enables spending) and viewing key (which enables monitoring incoming transactions). Unlike higher-level commands such as `z_getnewaddress`, this raw command exposes all key components directly to the user rather than storing them in the wallet. The generated shielded address can receive confidential values that are hidden from public view on the blockchain, supporting the privacy features of the Verus protocol. The secret key (zcsecretkey) is the critical component that enables spending funds sent to the address and must be kept secure. The viewing key (zcviewingkey) allows monitoring incoming transactions without enabling spending, providing a separation of monitoring and control capabilities. This low-level command gives advanced users direct access to the cryptographic components of shielded addresses, but places responsibility on the user to manage these keys securely outside the wallet infrastructure.

**Command Type**: Low-level/Key Management  
**Protocol Level**: Cryptographic  
**Access Requirement**: None  
**Deprecated Status**: This command is deprecated

## Arguments
This command does not accept any arguments.

## Results
The command returns an object containing the generated address and keys.

**Return Type**: Object

## Examples

### Example 1: Generate a new shielded address and keys

**Command:**
```
verus zcrawkeygen
```

**Sample Output:**
```

```

## Potential Error Cases

1. **Potential Error - Memory Allocation:**
   ```
   error code: -4
   error message:
   Error allocating memory for key generation
   ```

2. **Potential Error - Random Number Generation:**
   ```
   error code: -4
   error message:
   Error in random number generation
   ```

3. **Potential Error - Authentication Failure:**
   ```
   error code: -1
   error message:
   Incorrect username or password
   ```

## Notes
DEPRECATED. This command is intended primarily for development, testing, and educational purposes. It generates keys without storing them in the wallet, meaning the user is responsible for their secure storage and management. The zcsecretkey is the most sensitive component and grants full spending capability, while the zcviewingkey only enables monitoring incoming transactions. These keys are in a format specific to the Zcash protocol that Verus implements. Unlike addresses generated with `z_getnewaddress`, the zcaddress generated by this command will not be automatically tracked by the wallet unless explicitly imported using appropriate commands. For most use cases, the higher-level `z_getnewaddress` command is more appropriate as it handles key generation and secure storage within the wallet infrastructure.
