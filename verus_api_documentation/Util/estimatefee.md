# Verus RPC Command: estimatefee

## Purpose
The `estimatefee` command is designed to provide an approximate calculation of the fee per kilobyte that would be required for a transaction to be included in a block within a specified number of blocks. This command is essential for users to manage transaction costs efficiently, especially during periods of network congestion, ensuring transactions are processed within desired timeframes.

## Description
The `estimatefee` command analyzes recent network activity and fee trends to predict the minimum fee necessary for transaction inclusion within the target number of blocks. The estimation is based on historical fee data and network conditions, providing a reliable guidance for transaction fee selection. If insufficient data exists to make an accurate prediction, the command returns the minimum network fee.

**Command Type**: Query/Read-only  
**Protocol Level**: Transaction Fee Layer  
**Access Requirement**: Basic node access

## Arguments
The command accepts a single parameter:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `nblocks` | numeric | Yes | Target number of blocks for transaction confirmation |

## Results
The command returns a single numeric value:

**Return Type**: Numeric

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| n | The estimated fee per kilobyte (in VRSC) needed for transaction confirmation within the specified number of blocks |

If insufficient transaction data exists to make an accurate estimation, the command will return the network's minimum fee requirement.

## Examples

### Example: Estimate Fee for Confirmation Within 6 Blocks

**Command:**
```
verus estimatefee 6
```

**Potential Output:**
```
0.00001000
```

This example demonstrates:
- How to query the estimated fee for a transaction to be confirmed within 6 blocks
- The returned value (0.00001000 VRSC per kilobyte) represents the estimated fee based on current network conditions

## Potential Error Cases

1. **Potential Error - Invalid Block Count:**
   ```
   error code: -8
   error message:
   Invalid block count: must be between 1 and 25
   ```

2. **Potential Error - Negative Block Count:**
   ```
   error code: -8
   error message:
   Block count cannot be less than 1
   ```

3. **Potential Error - Non-numeric Input:**
   ```
   error code: -8
   error message:
   Expected numeric block count
   ```

4. **Potential Warning - Limited Data Available:**
   ```
   warning:
   Fee estimation has limited data available
   ```
   
   In this case, the command would still return a value, but it would be the minimum fee rather than a dynamically calculated estimate.
